          What is RAM and what does it do?
        </p>
        <p class="text-top">
          RAM, stands for Random Access Memory and is a crucial component in any computer. It is a type of  memory that is used to store data and code currently being used. Unlike the long-term storage provided by hard drives or SSDs, RAM provides fast and temporary storage that the computers processor can access quickly, allowing for multitasking and efficient data processing.

        <p class="title-text">
          How RAM works
        </p>
        <p>
          When you run a program or open a file, the data is loaded from your storage drive (HHD or SSD) into the computers RAM. This allows the processor to access the data quickly, rather than retrieving it from the slower storage devices. RAM is much faster than traditional storage, but it's also very fragile because it loses all its data when the computer is powered off.

          Megahertz (MHz)
        </p>
        <p>
          Megahertz measures the speed of components like RAM. A higher megahertz values indicates that the components can process data faster, but the MHz performance in real life can vary based on the specific application. RAM with a higher MHz rating can transfer data to and from the processor quicker, leading to improved system performance.

          Gigabytes (GB)
        </p>
        <p>
          Gigabytes indicate the storage capacity of storage components like RAM. RAM size is usually measured in gigabytes, expressing how much data your computer can work with at a time. A computer with more gigabytes of RAM can handle larger and more complex applications, allowing for multitasking and better performance.

          Different types of RAM
        </p>
        <p class="text-top">
          There are different types of RAM, including DDR (Double Data Rate), DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5. Each new generation offers increased speed and efficiency, allowing for better performance in modern computer systems. The type of RAM your computer uses depends on its motherboard and processor compatibility.

          Having sufficient RAM
        </p>
        <p>
          Having an sufficient amount of RAM is important for ensuring that your computer runs properly, especially when running resource intensive applications such as video editing software or games. If your computer doesn't have enough RAM to handle the tasks you're performing, it can lead to slow performance, system crashes, and overall inefficiency.
